# Project Movies

This week project was done by Sherin and Kyung-jin-cho. The assignment to create a multi page React application using themoviedb.org's API to fetch a list of movies and linking to a movie detail page when clicked on a movie

## The problem

The challenge was to fetch data by asynchronous calls and tried to render a component before requested data is received. Then the browser gives back compile error. We solved the issue by applying conditional operator and make react to render only when the data is not undefined :)
